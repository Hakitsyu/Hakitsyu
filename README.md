### Hi, my name is Vitor 👻

Hello, my name is Vitor
I'm currently 19 years old, I started studying programming at the age of 11 on my own because of the Minecraft game. I am a specialist in software architecture and a great admirer of Domain Driven Design but I have extensive knowledge in various technologies.

Microservices, Domain Driven Design, Event Driven Architecture, CQRS, CQS, Event Sourcing, Observability, ELK, Keycloack, Multi Tenancy, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, Distributed Cache and a lot more........

Among other technologies that I learned and used when necessary 💻 I have basic knowledge of Linux, I only used simple distros like **Mint** and **CentOS** 🐧.
