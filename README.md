### Hi, my name is Victor 👻

I'm currently 18 years old, I started studying programming at 11 on my own, I'm very curious and I like to "tinker" with everything 🐶.

It all started because of the Minecraft game and its servers, I started learning Java and nowadays I have knowledge of several technologies such as:

- Java
- JavaScript
- HMTL
- CSS
- NodeJS
- C#
- PHP
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- React
- CodeIgniter
- Arduino
- TypeScript
- Angular
- ASP.NET
- NestJS
- EntityFramework
- Spring
- Go

Among other technologies that I learned and used when necessary 💻 I have basic knowledge of Linux, I only used simple distros like **Mint** and **CentOS** 🐧.
