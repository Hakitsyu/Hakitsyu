### Hi, my name is Vitor 👻

I'm currently 18 years old, I started studying programming at 11 on my own, I'm very curious and I like to "tinker" with everything 🐶.

It all started because of the Minecraft game and its servers, I started learning Java and nowadays I have knowledge of several technologies such as:

Java, Spring, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Go, SQL, MongoDB, React, CodeIgniter, Arduino, TypeScript, Angular, ASP.NET, NestJS, EntityFramework, Spring, Java Swing, Java FX, Grafana,Team City, RabbitMQ, Kafka, gRPC.

Among other technologies that I learned and used when necessary 💻 I have basic knowledge of Linux, I only used simple distros like **Mint** and **CentOS** 🐧.

If you want to contact me 📞
