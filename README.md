### Hi, my name is Vitor 👻

Hello, my name is Vitor (A simple Java lover).
I'm currently 19 years old, I started studying programming at the age of 11 on my own because of the Minecraft game, I'm very curious and I like to "tinker" with everything. I have knowledge of some things, such as

Java, Spring, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Go, SQL, MongoDB, React, CodeIgniter, Arduino, TypeScript, Angular, Flutter, Dart, ASP.NET, NestJS, EntityFramework, Spring, Java Swing, Java FX, Grafana, Team City, RabbitMQ, Kafka, gRPC, Azure, Liquibase.

Among other technologies that I learned and used when necessary 💻 I have basic knowledge of Linux, I only used simple distros like **Mint** and **CentOS** 🐧.
